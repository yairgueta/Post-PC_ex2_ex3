# AndroidCalculator - Calculator exercise for Android developers

## In this project:
- Calculator screen with XML ready for portrait and landscape
- Calculator interface used by the Activity
- Unit tests for the calculator and the activity

## Your job:
- Implement `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- add more unit tests to `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- Implement `MainActivity.java`
- add more unit tests to `MainActivityTest.java`
- add more flow tests to `AppFlowTest.java`



Good luck!

Answer to question:
we would need to add another method to SimpleCalculator which can be called "insertMult" and will
just insert multiplication to the output. Therefore, we would need to implement this method in
SimpleCalculatorImpl class, and add the support for this operator in output and inertEqual.
also, we would need to add click listener for the new button in the main activity.

tests - we could test the new method insertMult and its calculations. also, we could test the new
button and what happens when it is clicked.
